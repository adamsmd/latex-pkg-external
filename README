# The `external` package: A LaTeX package for rendering LaTeX code in separate external documents

The `external` package allows you to include the result of rendering
LaTeX code in a separate document that has its own preamble.  This is
useful when you want to use symbols from a package that you do not want
to load into your main document.  For example, your main document may
use symbols from multiple packages that conflict or otherwise cannot be
loaded together.

## Installing

To install, copy `external.sty` and `external.code.sty` to somewhere in
the style-file search path for LaTeX.

## Example Usages

Using `\textbeta` without having to load the `textgreek` package in the
main document:

    An atom undergoing
    \external[preamble={\usepackage{textgreek}}]{\textbeta-decay}
    can emit an electron.

The same but as an environment:

    An atom undergoing
    \begin{externalenv}[preamble={\usepackage{textgreek}}]
    \textbeta-decay
    \end{externalenv}
    ~can emit an electron.

Typesetting external code as display math:

    The solution to the two dimensional integral
    \external[preamble={\usepackage{amsmath}}, math=display]
    {\iint xy\,dx\,dy}
    is involves $x^2$ and $y^2$.

For more details, see the documentation in `external.pdf`.

## Building Documentation

To build the documentation for this package, run `make`.  This will
produce a documentation file named `external.pdf`.

WARNING: This also produces a large number (~200) of temporary files in
the current directory.  They all have filenames of the form
`external-external-*`.  You can delete these files by running the
command `make clean`.
